### Exploring the startup process of computers and how to secure it

I had the pleasure to be invited to present at [College IT Conference](https://citc.college/) at the National Space Centre. 

### Abstract

*“Have you tried turning it off and on again?”* is a prevalent IT guy catchphrase championed by many comedy shows. While the parody lives on however, so does the question itself. 

But why? Marko explores the startup process of computers to answer the question why IT people aren’t lazy by asking colleagues to do this but save time avoiding manual troubleshooting. You will be taken on a journey from simple non-bootstrap loading systems to latest developments in securing the startup process.
