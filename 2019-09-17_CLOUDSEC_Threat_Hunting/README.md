# Threat Hunting
### Challenges, Opportunities, and Lessons Learned from our Journey to the Cloud

I had the pleasure to be invited to present at [CLOUDSEC London 2019](http://www.cloudsec.com/uk/) at the Old Billingsgate close to Tower Bridge. 

### Abstract

Staying a step ahead of your adversaries is one of the most promising strategies to defend your organisation. While it may seem aggressive to work on the “assumption of breach”, the reality is that attackers may operate undetected inside a network for days, weeks, and even months on end, to prepare for and execute their attack without any automated defense solution detecting their presence. Threat hunting stops these attacks by seeking out covert indicators of compromise (IOCs) so attacks can be mitigated before the adversary can achieve their objectives.

Combing logs and audit data for indicators of compromise (IOCs) can be tedious, time consuming and expensive. By proactively capturing and storing relevant activity, whether known to be bad or not, enterprises can instantly leverage a comprehensive historical record of their environment for effective threat hunting.

While cloud computing makes security more difficult in many different ways, there are specific challenges for the threat detection and response function. Visibility is the key to full and effective threat detection. The Cloud can create a substantial blind spot in an organization's IT infrastructure: indicators of compromise go unseen; ones that would be picked up easily if the same application were deployed on-premises. For alerts generated on-premises, critical correlation data can be missed, leaving an incomplete view of the full scope of an attack.

In this presentation we will demonstrate examples and lessons learned from the University of Oxford's Cyber Security Incident Response Team in their journey to the cloud.
