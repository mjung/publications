# The Egg of Columbus

I had the pleasure to present at [JAMF Nation User Conference](https://jamfnation.jamfsoftware.com/jnucEvent.html?eventId=36&view=info) the slightly refined workflow incorporating the Casper Suite.

### Abstract

Columbus was dining with many Spanish nobles when one of them said: 'Sir Christopher, even if your lordship had not discovered the Indies, there would have been, here in Spain which is a country abundant with great men knowledgeable in cosmography and literature, one who would have started a similar adventure with the same result.' Columbus did not respond to these words but asked for a whole egg to be brought to him. He placed it on the table and said: 'My lords, I will lay a wager with any of you that you are unable to make this egg stand on its end like I will do without any kind of help or aid.'

Marko will discuss some creative but easy solutions for thin imaging and no imaging-based workflows using the Casper Suite. We will also try to solve Columbus’ puzzle.

### Event review

> Cam Evjen got things started with the backstory to this session description. Marko Jung, team lead at the University of Oxford and longtime FOJ (friend of JAMF), is a wonderful speaker. When Cam asked Marko if he’d participate in this year’s JNUC, the answer was a resounding “yes.” “Ok Marko, we’ll need a session description to get things started, and we can build our Keynote later.” A week goes by, then two… “Marko?” No “Polo” was heard on the other end. Until finally, right before schedules went to print, Cam received a session description all about the Egg of Columbus.

> So what’s the Egg of Columbus, anyway? In short, it’s a brilliant idea or discovery that seems simple or obvious to others after the fact. Once a feat has been done, anyone can know how to do it. This was exactly Marko’s point. With the wealth of knowledge our fellow admins have acquired from the six Apple operating system releases and seven hardware releases in the last year alone, why not take some imaging cues from our fellow admins? Marko proceeded to crack the proverbial egg wide open and served up a smorgasbord of fresh imaging strategies and principles. The crowd ate it up.
  
### Credits

I would like to thank [Aaron](https://github.com/oucsaw/), [Chris](https://github.com/cdbeard), and Robin for their hard work to make all this happen. A bit thank you to Cameron Evjen and all my friends at JAMF Software for inviting me on stage again.
