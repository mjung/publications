# Information Security from a CSIRT Perspective

I had the pleasure to present at [MacSysAdmin](http://macsysadmin.se/2017/Home.html) the fifth year in a row. [Tycho](https://twitter.com/tychosjogren) allowed me to give a brief insight in the toolchain of an Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT).
