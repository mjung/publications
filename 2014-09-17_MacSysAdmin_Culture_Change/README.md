# Culture Change

I had the pleasure to present at [MacSysAdmin](http://macsysadmin.se/2014/Home.html) the success of our iPad one-to-one program and some wider thoughts on how we are changing the way we deliver Apple client management to our users.

### Abstract

The consumerisation of IT dramatically impacts user expectations of IT as staff members become more familiar with technology. The increased pace of product release cycles as well as the continuous emerge of new applications and cloud services force us to rethink our approach to service development and delivery.

As IT professionals we need to understand the big picture and to identify the hot topics we should care about â€” how that context influences our decisions and changes our actions. We have to abandon the "not invented here" attitude. Innovation can come from anywhere in our organisation. IT must adopt an innovation, adapt it to secure and support, and then be prepared to change it as it evolves.
