# The College Challenge – Mac Management at the University of Oxford

I had the pleasure to present at [JAMF Nation User Conference 2012 (JNUC)](http://www.jamfsoftware.com/blog/video-the-college-challenge-mac-management-at-the-university-of-oxford/) to first present in public our approach to Mac management using the JAMF Casper Suite.

### Abstract

In response to the rapid growth of Mac users at the University of Oxford, their IT department has developed the Managed Mac Platform (MMP)—using the Casper Suite as a robust framework to deploy their Macs on a large scale. This program has allowed the University of Oxford's IT team to build and maintain their Macs, while remaining flexible for every different Mac use case across the university. In this session we will discuss the architecture of the MMP, as well as share the enlightening solutions developed by their IT team for common OS X management challenges seen in education.
